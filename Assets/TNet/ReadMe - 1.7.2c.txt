  Stand-Alone Server
-----------------------------------------------------

You can build a stand-alone server by extracting the contents of the "TNetServer.zip" file
into the project's root folder (outside the Assets folder), then opening up the TNServer
solution or csproj file. A pre-compiled stand-alone windows executable is also included
in the ZIP file for your convenience.

1.6.0:
- NEW: Added a script that can instantiate an object when the player enters the scene (think: player avatar).
